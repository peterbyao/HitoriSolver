# Hitori/SAT solver

A Hitori solver written in Haskell. Our implementation represents the board state as a satisfiability problem and then solves it.

## Build/Run instructions

Build the solver with

```
stack build
```

and run it with

```
stack run <path-to-file> <filetype> <solver-algorithm> [spark-threshold]
```
